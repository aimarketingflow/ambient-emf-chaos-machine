- **Delay**: 25ms fast response
- **Method**: Jam Bluetooth connections → Sniff reconnection attempts
- **Target**: Bluetooth device exploitation

### 4. 📱 Cellular IMSI Catcher Attack
- **Frequency**: 1.8 GHz (GSM 1800)
- **Delay**: 200ms response injection
- **Method**: IMSI catcher with delayed response manipulation
- **Target**: Mobile device identification and tracking

### 5. 📶 LTE Downgrade Attack
- **Frequency**: 2.1 GHz → 900 MHz (LTE to GSM)
- **Delay**: 150ms downgrade timing
- **Method**: Force LTE devices to downgrade to less secure GSM
- **Target**: Mobile security degradation

## 🚀 Quick Launch

### Option 1: Interactive Menu
```bash
cd /Users/flowgirl/Documents/EMF_Chaos_Engine
python3 launch_attack_experiments.py
```

### Option 2: Direct Experiment
```bash
# Run specific experiment
python3 advanced_sdr_attack_experiments.py gsm_intercept_replay

# Run all experiments (full attack battery)
python3 advanced_sdr_attack_experiments.py
```

## 🎯 Experiment Phases

Each attack experiment runs through 4 phases:

1. **📡 Baseline Capture** - Record normal RF environment
2. **⚡ Attack Transmission** - Execute attack with timing delay
3. **📡 Post-Attack Capture** - Record environment changes
4. **🎯 Replay Attack** - Replay captured data with delay manipulation

## 📝 Results & Logging

### Automatic Logging
- **JSON Log**: `/Users/flowgirl/Documents/EMF_Chaos_Engine/WarfareLogs/advanced_sdr_experiments_TIMESTAMP.json`
- **Markdown Summary**: Same directory with `.md` extension
- **Real-time Console**: Live experiment progress and results

### Log Contents
- Experiment timestamps and phases
- Frequency and delay parameters
- Capture file sizes and locations
- Success/failure status for each phase
- Error details and troubleshooting info

## 🛡️ Hardware Requirements

### Validated Setup
- **HackRF One**: Serial 78d063dc2b6f6967 (your unit)
- **Frequency Range**: 1 MHz - 6 GHz full duplex
- **Sample Rate**: 20 MHz (configurable)
- **TX/RX Gains**: Optimized for each experiment type
