## üéØ Strategic Questions for AI Venture Pitch Experts

### **Core Positioning Questions**

1. **"Weekend Project" Narrative:**
   - Is positioning this as a "weekend project" too humble/underselling the sophistication?
   - Or does it create the perfect "imagine what I could do with funding" hook?
   - Should we emphasize the technical complexity more upfront?

2. **Viral Success Leverage:**
   - How do we best capitalize on the LinkedIn viral moment without it seeming like a flash-in-the-pan?
   - What's the optimal way to present "broke the internet" as sustainable market validation?

3. **Open Source Strategy:**
   - Is open sourcing the core tech a strength (transparency, community) or weakness (IP concerns)?
   - How do we position open source as a competitive advantage vs. traditional proprietary approaches?

### **Market & Competition Questions**

4. **TAM Sizing:**
   - Is our $140B+ TAM calculation credible? (RF Security $45B + Surveillance Detection $28B + Counter-Surveillance $67B)
   - Should we focus on a smaller, more defensible market segment initially?

5. **"Essential on Both Sides" Strategy:**
   - Is the dual-market positioning (surveillance + counter-surveillance) compelling or confusing?
   - How do we present this without seeming opportunistic or ethically ambiguous?

6. **Competitive Differentiation:**
   - Is the $150 Pi vs $50K+ enterprise equipment comparison too stark to be believable?
   - What are the strongest competitive moats beyond cost advantage?

### **Technical Credibility Questions**

7. **288% Range Amplification:**
   - How technical should we get about the RF amplification algorithms?
   - Is this claim strong enough to differentiate but not so bold as to invite skepticism?

8. **Hardware Scalability:**
   - How do we bridge from Pi prototype to enterprise-grade solution?
   - What's the credible path from $150 hardware to scalable business model?

### **Investment & Valuation Questions**

9. **Current Offers Positioning:**
   - How do we present the $10-20M acquisition offers without seeming like we're shopping around?
   - Should these be presented as validation or as the floor for investment valuation?

10. **ROI Projections:**
    - Is 500-1000% 3-year ROI too aggressive or appropriately ambitious?
    - What metrics/comparables should we use to justify these projections?

### **Demo & Presentation Questions**

11. **Live Demo Strategy:**
    - Should we lead with live demo or build up to it?
    - What's the risk/reward of detecting investors' devices in real-time during pitch?

12. **"Big Guns" Teaser:**
    - How much should we reveal about advanced capabilities planned for 2026?
    - Is the mystery/teaser approach effective or frustrating for investors?

### **Business Model Questions**

13. **Revenue Streams:**
    - Hardware sales vs. software licensing vs. SaaS platform - what's the optimal mix?
    - How do we monetize the open source core while maintaining community trust?

14. **Go-to-Market Strategy:**
    - B2B enterprise vs. B2C consumer vs. B2G government - which market first?
    - What's the most credible path to first revenue and scaling?

### **Risk & Mitigation Questions**

15. **Regulatory Concerns:**
    - Are there regulatory risks with RF detection/jamming capabilities?
    - How do we address potential dual-use technology concerns?

16. **Technical Risks:**
    - What are the biggest technical hurdles in scaling from Pi to enterprise?
    - How do we de-risk the hardware dependencies and supply chain?

### **Team & Execution Questions**

17. **Solo Founder Concerns:**
    - How do we address potential investor concerns about single-person technical risk?
    - What's the hiring roadmap and key roles to fill first?

18. **Execution Timeline:**
    - Is Q4 2025 launch realistic given current development state?
    - What are the key milestones and potential delays?
