# 🏆 Battle-Tested: Proven Under Fire

*Most security tools are built in labs. The EMF Chaos Engine was forged under fire.*

## 🎯 Real-World Threat Neutralizations

### 2024-2025: Four Major Hostile Takedowns

**1. 📡 Stingray Device Neutralization**
- **Location**: Urban environment, suspected law enforcement overreach
- **Threat**: IMSI catcher intercepting cellular communications
- **Response**: EMF Chaos Engine detected anomalous cellular patterns, deployed targeted interference
- **Result**: Device forced offline within 30 seconds, normal cellular service restored

**2. 🔍 Live Data Exfiltration Block**
- **Context**: Targeted attack on personal network infrastructure
- **Threat**: Sophisticated APT attempting real-time data extraction
- **Detection**: Behavioral mesh analysis identified coordinated rogue actors
- **Outcome**: Exfiltration tunnel severed, attack vector eliminated

**3. 🌐 Coordinated Network Attack Disruption**
- **Scale**: Multi-vector attack across 12+ access points
- **Threat**: Persistent "BK" attack device with advanced evasion capabilities
- **Response**: RF counter-suite deployment with adaptive pattern matching
- **Result**: Entire attack infrastructure neutralized, threat actors forced to retreat

**4. 📱 Bluetooth Tracking Network Exposure**
- **Discovery**: Hidden beacon network logging movement patterns
- **Scope**: 50+ concealed tracking devices across 2-mile radius
